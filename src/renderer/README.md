The material could be converted to `.binary` format, following [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/downloads/BRDF) format.

Rendering: we use [Mitsuba](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/), a physically based renderer, to render the 3D models with the synthesized materials.  You may find [Neural-BRDF](https://github.com/asztr/Neural-BRDF) helpful.
