[Optionally] To train the NBRDF model from scratch, please download MERL dataset from [MERL](https://www.merl.com/research/downloads/BRDF) and put the binary files in the `data/merl` folder.

For data augmentation, we also provide the linear interpolation list for the MERL dataset at [interpolation list](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Peter2023HuggingFace/NeuMERL/tree/main/interpolate).
