For material synthesis, the weights of the pre-trained base models are uploaded at Hugging Face [Synthesis model weights](https://huggingface.co/Peter2023HuggingFace/NeuMaDiff).  Please download the model weights and put them in the `model` folder.

Optionally, to train the NeuMERL model from scratch, please download the [initial model weights](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Peter2023HuggingFace/NeuMERL/blob/main/mlp_weights_ini.pth) and put them in the `model` folder.
